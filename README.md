# Chatbot (beginner)

In this project, we tested and practiced the basics of programming using a simple chatbot implementation. The goal was to explore fundamental concepts such as:
- Variables and data types
- Conditional statements (if, else, elif)
- Loops (for, while)
- Functions and modular code
- Input/output handling
- Basic error checking
- Simple logic and control flow

To make learning more interactive and practical, we implemented a basic chatbot that simulates a conversation with a user. The chatbot can answer simple questions, respond to greetings, and demonstrate how programming logic can be used to build user-friendly applications.

This project helped build a strong foundation for more advanced programming topics by applying concepts in a hands-on and engaging way.
